# Roamie

_A travel companion for exploring near and far!_

# Description

Roamie accompanies users as they explore their home city or a city they're just visiting for the first time! She offers users options in digestible sets of three for activities or places to visit based on their preferences (budget, interests, favorite activities) and their location, and allows users to rate and describe their experiences through words and pictures in a trip diary that they can share with friends. As users visit a new place, Roamie will serve up new suggestions for what to do next, and a map visualization will show where the user has been so far and what they've done.

Roamie can remind a user of a beautiful day they spent in their hometown, or help tell the story of the spots they visited while adventuring away from home.
